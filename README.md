# soundcloud-id-helper-mac
A simple Mac app for finding SoundCloud IDs.

### How To Use

* Download [SoundCloud_Helper.zip](./SoundCloud_Helper.zip)
* Open the ZIP file
* Open SoundCloud Helper.app (Note: in order to get around macOS' system integrity features, you may need to right-click on the app icon, select "Open", and then "Open" again in the challenge prompt. Simply double-clicking the icon may not work)
* Optionally drag the app to your /Applications folder
* Paste a SoundCloud URL into the text box, and click "Fetch SoundCloud ID"
* That's it!
